   <h4>What is this project for?</h4>
    <p>This project is made so we can learn to make a SPA. A SPA is a "Single Page Application", and is basically so you load EVERYTHING in one go.</p>
    <p>We have used mongo, express, angular and node, also known as "MEAN".</p>
    <p>We load about 20.000 files from a database, which then have a title, an abstract, links, headings and categories. In our "Articles" you can search on something, that includes in the title. Meaning, that you can search on "Rabbit", and everything within the search comes up. If you then press Pluto, you can see that nothing in the abstract includes the word "Rabbit", but one of the links in Pluto includes the word you searched after.</p>
    <p>In our "Categories", we have a "A-Z" bar that shows 10 of the categories with the chosen element. If you press "M", it shows you 10 categories with "M". Down on the page, you can click on the the arrows, and it will navigate you to the next 10 categories under categories "M". You can then click on one of those categories, and it will show you a title. If you click on the title, it will show the details from it. </p>
